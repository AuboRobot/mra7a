The stack is for spawning manipulation scenarios in gazebo.
Note that simulation stays in 'paused' mode after the objects are spawned.

For launching the Pitcher-Mug scenario:
roslaunch pither_mug_scenario pither_mug.launch 

For launching the Table Setting Scenario:
roslaunch table_setting_scenario table_setup.launch
